# Mock eCommerce Website Assignment

## Project Outline

### 1. Project Setup
- **Framework**: Choose a framework (React, Next.js, etc.) for the frontend.

- Featured products section.
- Categories or promotional banners.

#### Product Listing Page
- Display a grid or list of products with:

  - `GET /api/products` - Returns a list of products.
  - `POST /api/cart` - Adds a product to the cart.
  - `POST /api/checkout` - Processes the payment.

### 4. Frontend Implementation

### 5. Backend Implementation
- Set up an Express.js server.
- Create routes for the mock APIs.
- Use middleware for error handling.

### 6. Styling
- Use CSS, Tailwind CSS, or styled-components to style the pages.
- Ensure the design is responsive.

### 7. Testing and Debugging
- Test the flow from product selection to checkout.
- Make sure to handle edge cases (e.g., out of stock products, invalid payment details).

### 8. Submission
- Package your code in a Git repository.
- Ensure to include a README file with:
  - Project description.
  - Instructions to run the application.
  - Any additional information relevant to your submission.

## Timeline
- **Day 1**: Project setup, homepage, and product listing page.

- **Day 3**: Checkout page and mock payment success/failure pages.
- **Day 4**: Testing, debugging, and final touches.
